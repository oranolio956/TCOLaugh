## 🌑 **What is Oranolio?**

Oranolio is not just another penetration testing framework—it's a **digital predator** that stalks the corporate wilderness, a **shadow hunter** that moves unseen through network architectures, and a **silent infiltrator** that penetrates the deepest layers of enterprise security.

Born from the darkest corners of cybersecurity research, Oranolio represents the **evolution of digital warfare**. It's the tool that makes security teams question their defenses, that makes blue teams lose sleep, and that makes red teams achieve the impossible.

### 🎯 **Core Philosophy**

*"In the realm of cybersecurity, there are those who build walls, and there are those who become the shadow that slips through every crack. Oranolio is the latter."*
