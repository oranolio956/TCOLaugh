# Server Stability Fixes - TCOLaugh C2 Framework

## Summary
Fixed server configuration for improved stability and accessibility using both Render and Netlify APIs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server Configuration (`dist/profile.json`)
- ✅ Updated to support improved server responses
- ✅ Added CORS headers for better web integration
- ✅ Changed server response to return JSON status instead of 404
- ✅ Improved headers for better compatibility

### 2. Dockerfile Improvements (`Dockerfile.render`)
- ✅ Removed invalid command-line flags (`-ah -ce` that don't exist in AdaptixServer)
- ✅ Added startup script (`dist/start-server.sh`) that properly handles Render's `PORT` environment variable
- ✅ Simplified configuration to use command-line flags for better stability
- ✅ Ensures dynamic port assignment works correctly with Render

### 3. Startup Script (`dist/start-server.sh`)
- ✅ Reads `PORT` from environment (defaults to 10000 for Render)
- ✅ Uses command-line flags for reliable configuration
- ✅ Properly configures SSL certificates and endpoint

### 4. Health Check Dashboard
- ✅ Created `health-check.html` for monitoring server status
- ✅ Added to Netlify site for easy access
- ✅ Real-time server status monitoring
- ✅ Connection testing capabilities

### 5. Git Repository Updates
- ✅ Merged `main` branch into `master` (Render deploys from `master`)
- ✅ All improvements committed and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Triggered automatic deployment on Render

## Deployment Status

### Render (C2 Server)
- **Service ID**: `srv-d40uhdn5r7bs7388can0`
- **URL**: `https://tcolaugh-c2.onrender.com`
- **Status**: Auto-deploying from `master` branch
- **Configuration**: Using startup script with dynamic PORT handling

### Netlify (Phishing Site)
- **Site ID**: `nfp_ipxfC11Ujv9gD1TmM6mMsmy8jg5dpoeg7f5f`
- **Features**: Health check dashboard added
- **Status**: Updated with monitoring capabilities

## Key Improvements

1. **Port Configuration**: Startup script now properly reads Render's `PORT` environment variable
2. **Stability**: Removed invalid flags that could cause server startup failures
3. **Monitoring**: Added health check dashboard for real-time status
4. **Compatibility**: Ensured proper integration with Render's infrastructure

## Testing

### HTTPS Connection
```bash
curl -k https://tcolaugh-c2.onrender.com/tcolaugh
```

### Health Check
Visit: `https://tcolaugh-c2.onrender.com/health-check.html` (via Netlify site)

### Client Connection
Use AdaptixClient GUI with:
- **Server URL**: `https://tcolaugh-c2.onrender.com/tcolaugh`
- **Password**: `TCOLaugh2025!Secure`
- **Username**: `admin` / Password: `Admin@TCO2025!`

## Notes

- The server uses HTTPS only (as required by AdaptixServer architecture)
- Render's proxy handles SSL termination and forwards HTTPS to the backend
- The startup script ensures compatibility with Render's dynamic port assignment
- All configuration is now more stable and maintainable

## Next Steps

1. Wait for Render deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)
2. Test HTTPS connection to verify server is accessible
3. Use AdaptixClient GUI to connect to the server
4. Monitor health check dashboard for ongoing status
